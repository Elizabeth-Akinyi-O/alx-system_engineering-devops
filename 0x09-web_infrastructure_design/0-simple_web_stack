INFRASTRUCTURE:

Server: Is a type of computer that shares information with other computers.
It can be a computer, software program or hard drive.
It's ultimate function is to receive, store and share data.


Domain Name Role: It helps to identify internet resources such as
computers and networks with a text-based label that is easier to
memorize compared to numerical adresses (IP addresses).


Type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com: It is a `cname`
(canonical name) in the DNS record that maps an alias name to
a true or canonical domain name.


Role of the web server: It is to store, process and deliver
requested information or webpages to end users.


Role of the application server: It acts as the host or container
for the user's business logic while facilitating access to and
performance of the business application.


Role of the database: It is used to store, retrieve and update
information / data.


What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user
requesting the website: The HTTP protocol.



ISSUES:

SPOF (Single Point Of Failure): The infrastructure has one server
which contains only one web server, application server and database.
If the SPOF fails...the entire system stops works.


Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server
needs to be restarted): Since the server depends on one code base,
the downtime period is likely to be longer that it should be.
This leads to loss of traffic and a bad user experince for the users
when they are not able to access the website and it's contents.


Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic: The domain name points directly
to the server and does not contain a load balancer. This poses an issue to
the volume of users trying to access the website's content, and may set a
limit to the number of users the website can accomodate.

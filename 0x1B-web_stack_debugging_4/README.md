Web stack debugging 4 - testing how well our web server setup featuring Nginx is doing under pressure (its getting a huge amount of failed requests).

- For the benchmarking, use ApacheBench. Make 2000 requests to the server with 100 requests at a time.
- Fix the stack to get to 0 failed requests.

Change the OS configuration so that it is possible to login with the holberton user and open a file without any error message.
